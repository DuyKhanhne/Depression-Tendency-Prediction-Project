# Depression Tendency Prediction Insight By Comparing Factors Using Logistic Regression, Random Forest

## Purpose and Outcome
- **Purpose**: To predict the tendency of depression based on information on individuals with various attributes related to their personal and lifestyle factors.
- **Outcome**: Accurate metrics and insights into factors influencing depression.

## Dataset
- **Source**: Depression dataset
- **Description**: This dataset contains information on individuals with various attributes related to their personal and lifestyle factors.
- **Structure**:
  - **Name**: The full name of the individual.
  - **Age**: The age of the individual in years.
  - **Marital Status**: The marital status of the individual. Possible values include Single, Married, Divorced, and Widowed.
  - **Education Level**: The highest level of education attained by the individual. Possible values include High School, Associate Degree, Bachelor's Degree, Master's Degree, and PhD.
  - **Number of Children**: The number of children the individual has.
  - **Smoking Status**: Indicates whether the individual is a smoker or not. Possible values are Smoker, Former, and Non-smoker.
  - **Physical Activity Level**: The level of physical activity undertaken by the individual. Possible values include Sedentary, Moderate, and Active.
  - **Employment Status**: The employment status of the individual. Possible values include Employed and Unemployed.
  - **Income**: The annual income of the individual in USD.
  - **Alcohol Consumption**: The level of alcohol consumption. Possible values include Low, Moderate, and High.
  - **Dietary Habits**: The dietary habits of the individual. Possible values include Healthy, Moderate, and Unhealthy.
  - **Sleep Patterns**: The quality of sleep. Possible values include Good, Fair, and Poor.

  - **History of Substance Abuse**: Whether the individual has a history of substance abuse. Possible values are Yes and No.
  - **Family History of Depression**: Indicates if there is a family history of depression. Possible values are Yes and No.
  - **Chronic Medical Conditions**: Whether the individual has chronic medical conditions. Possible values are Yes and No.

## Initial Analysis Plan

### Data Preprocessing
1. **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, inconsistencies, potential outliers, and duplicates.
2. **Encoding Categorical Variables**: Convert categorical features (e.g., Marital Status, Smoking Status) into numerical values.
3. **Feature Scaling**: Scale numerical features (e.g., Age, Income) to a standard range to ensure the models perform optimally.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
1. **Descriptive Statistics**: Summarize the data to get a sense of the distribution of each variable.
2. **Cluster Analysis**: Group individuals into clusters based on their attributes to identify distinct lifestyles or socio-economic profiles.

### Model Building
1. **Logistic Regression**: Use logistic regression to predict the binary outcome for History of Mental Illness (Yes/No).
2. **Random Forest**: Use Random Forest to predict the binary outcome for History of Mental Illness (Yes/No).

### Interpretation and Evaluation
1. **Interpretation**: Examine the coefficients (for logistic regression) to understand the relationship between features and the likelihood of depression.
2. **Evaluation**: Assess model performance using metrics like accuracy.

### Visualization
- Create visualizations to better understand the relationships in data. This could include scatter plots, bar charts, or heat maps.

### Data Storytelling
- Present predictions and provide actionable recommendations for families, psychologists and medical social workers to pay more attention to the development of depression in similar individuals.
